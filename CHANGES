0.9.4 - Improved the bundle injection code which prevents an application from getting launched twice in some cases.

0.9.3 - Added compatibility with garbage collected applications. Installer now removes the InputManager version of SIMBL.

0.9.2 - Rebuilt the SIMBL as a combination OSAX and Agent. This addresses the issue InputManagers and 64-bit behavior on Snow Leopard (10.6). This release is backward compatible with Leopard (10.5) as well. This version also includes the packaging process, which is non-trivial.

0.8.3 - Imported the original SIMBL tree. Aside from minor source tweaks (adding license headers) this is functionally identical to 0.8.2.
